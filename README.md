# PA-keyboard
We propose PA-Keyboard, an adaptive design for Phase I pediatric trials that borrows information from concurrent adult trials. As new adult or pediatric data accumulate, PA-Keyboard updates dose‐escalation decisions, automatically determining how much to borrow based on consistency in toxicity profiles. It retains the simplicity, transparency, and clinician‐friendly features of the original Keyboard design, while improving efficiency and safety. Though focused on pediatrics, it also applies broadly to parallel studies in different populations (e.g. regions, ethnic groups, or disease subtypes) sharing similar dose‐toxicity skeletons.
